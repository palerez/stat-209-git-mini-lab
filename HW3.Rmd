##Exercise 2
The data came from fivethirtyeight.com. The graph consists of the variables: retail price of Marijguana, Wholesales, time measuered in months. The independent variable is time and the dependet varaibles are price and wholesales. 
##Exercise 3
The data is being visualised by using position to show that price has been dropping over time and so has wholesales. Colors are seperating the two variables. Also, some text is showing a specific action that directly affected the price of marijguana.
##Exercise 4 
This makes my understanding of the data easier since everything is labled and mainly depicted using position and size.

##Exercise 5
I would compare the data to colorado's.
